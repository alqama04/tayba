                            I have always been interested in beauty and the way people carry it in public
                            since my childhood, with an observational eye towards art, I always thought about
                            being in that industry. Colours, Emotions, Art have always been around my life as I felt connected with them.
                            then i went to @oraneinternationallucknow to learn the skills in more effective way ,after completing my tarining, 
                            I started providing makeup and hairstyling services (initially to close friends and
                            their functions and later on started getting recommendations).
                            I have always been working passionately towards crafting my skills as a makeup artist
                            and someone who transforms peopleâ€™s lives with my services.
                            <br />I thank those who have supported me with this journey and helped me become the artist I am today.
